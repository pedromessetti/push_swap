## Description
<p>
Optimized data sorting algorithm. The goal of this project is to sort in ascending order a stack with X amount of random different integers using a limited set of movement operations with the lowest possible count of movements.

All the functions used in this program are created by myself except for write(), malloc(), free() and exit(). For more information about the project check the subject here. My code was written following a bunch of rules and syntaxes formatting described in the 42 Norme. To check the Norme click here.

## Operation

<p>
Displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions,
that sorts the integers received as arguments.
At the beginning stack A has all the unsorted numbers and stack B is empty. At the end of the program stack A has to be in ascending order and stack B empty. For sorting we are allowed to use only the following moves:
